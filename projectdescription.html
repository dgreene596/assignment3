  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:normal;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;'>In this project, we propose to build an android application that is designed to organise other applications on the user&rsquo;s smartphone home screens. The purpose of the application will ease the burden on users in a world where smartphone applications are constantly being created and becoming more important in our daily lives for many things from banking to ordering food. As we progress further into the future not having a smartphone and the right application for the right company can make life difficult and things can easily be even more difficult if you can never find the app you are looking for.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:normal;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;'>&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:normal;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;'>The app will help keep the apps on the device organised and allow the user to feel better about the number of apps installed and the layout setup creating an easy way to view and navigate installed apps in a way that feels natural to the user and taking the stress out of having to desperately search for specific apps at different times.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:15px;line-height:106%;">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:normal;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;'>The main reason behind wanting to bring this app to life is due to my personal experience with the amount of different and varied apps installed on my phone. I often find myself scrolling up and down through my app drawer and searching my home screen to find the right app to order pizza through or the correct banking app to use as I bank with three different banks.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:normal;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;'>In this day and age, we find as apps will only become bigger and bigger in our lives it&rsquo;s important to put something in place that will ease the stress of searching through apps and keeping apps installed that are rarely or never used. If we were able to work on this project it would show future employers we understand the direction of technology and demands that might come from an end-user perspective.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong><span style="font-size:15px;line-height:106%;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:normal;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;'>The only product we have found that is similar was created for the iPhone 3 and was never expanded past that version. This product contained the ability to organise apps in iOS into folders and put page numbers on the screen, as the app is no longer available there is no further accessible information on this.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:normal;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;'>The main point of difference with the app we are wanting to create is it will be only for Android, to begin with, viewed to expand this to iOS if successful. The App Organiser will be packed with many more features than the competitors project with many more organisational features and pro features making things easy for the user by maintaining the apps itself.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong><span style="font-size:15px;line-height:106%;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:normal;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;'>The single aim of the project is to create an app that can organise all smartphone applications in the app drawer and on the home screen into name, colour or app type.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:normal;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;'>To fulfil the aim of the app we will need to be able to design and build a functioning android application that can check the category of an app as classed in the Play Store, see and read the name of apps and have the ability to determine the colour of an individual app icon so it can accurately organise each app into their relevant organisation class as determined by the user in the initial configuration of the App Organiser. Although many features will be planned for this application such as state checks to view if any new apps have been added or removed so it&rsquo;s able to organise them as per the settings and also recognise when an app hasn&rsquo;t been used in a pre-determined set of time so It&rsquo;s able to suggest removal or whitelist of the unused app.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:normal;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:normal;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;'>The most important part of the project is the base design of being able to organise apps into the three categories, without this goal being completed the app will be nothing so this is the main priority and the entire base of the idea. Other features can be added later along with additional organisational settings as suggested by users.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong><span style="font-size:15px;line-height:106%;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong><span style="font-size:15px;line-height:106%;">Plans and Progress</span></strong></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:106%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Our project is to create an application that will be able to organise and manage other applications on smartphones.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:106%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>The application itself has not started formal development at this stage as there is still plenty of scoping to do for how the app will be created and laid out and how we will implement desired features. As we are both very new to the world of app development there will be a long road ahead for what we want to achieve in the end goal of this app, including a huge amount of learning and trial, error and frustration.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:106%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>The plan is to first decide on the language that will be used to design the entire back end of the app, after deciding on what will be used we will begin to decide what features can and can&rsquo;t be implemented in the alpha version of the app dependent on the limitations of the chosen language we will work to build in the main function of the app which will be to organise apps into at least three categories; name, type of application and colour.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:106%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>The &ldquo;App Organiser&rdquo; idea came to fruition when myself and my housemates were sitting in the living room watching TV one night. One of my housemates Allison had just gotten a new phone and was sitting there meticulously organising each app into their colour category, sitting there getting frustrated while doing so. After about half an hour or so she finally finished and was happy with her OCD result, I thought it was a pretty strange way to organise them but the more people I had spoken to the more people I had found to do the same thing. I searched the Play Store and App Store trying to find an app that accomplished this with ease but was not able to find anything, this is where the idea for the &ldquo;App Organiser&rdquo; was created. Although the idea of this may seem ridiculous to some, I have found when surveying friends and family that if it existed, they would use it which was good enough for me.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:106%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>We only really started on the dormant idea properly when this university course began mid-year, it provided a reason to want to work toward this application idea. As the idea has progressed, more features that I believe would be helpful have been added to the desired list such as a notification once an app hasn&rsquo;t been used in x amount of days and a prompt to remove it if it is no longer required or whitelist it so it doesn&rsquo;t trigger the event when the time comes again and an auto-check feature to organise any new apps that may have been installed since the previous check. These are just ideas on ways to make the app more valuable and help with small tasks the user may not think of.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:106%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>In the overall the plan is only still in the beginning stages for many reasons, the main one being we don&rsquo;t know how to code or build an app yet. As we get further into the Bachelor of IT course we hope to gain more insight into the correct languages that should be used in app development as well as some practical know-how so we have a beginning point we can work from to start this journey fully.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:106%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>A possible avenue we have been investigating for the front end of the app is Android Studio, I have spent a good portion of time in the program playing with the application idea trying to figure out how to put basic things together for the user interface but at this stage, this is still an early look. I have also found a few &ldquo;no-code&rdquo; applications out there which boast to be able to build apps without the requirement of coding but as far as I have been able to tell from the ones I have previewed they are not for the personalised purpose we are seeking and would not be able to manage the desired task/s apart from the interface side of things. The more I investigate programs such as these it seems they are only created so people can make online stores or blogs.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:106%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>If this project were to be handed over it would first need to be investigated further on how it could communicate with the device concerning being able to organise the apps, as most phones already can organise via name or date added this could be modified to app type by pulling the developer category data from the app store itself (eg. Banking, utilities, games) and applying the organisation setting to move these into the desired position whether that be grouped, in folders or a list.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:106%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>The second organisational feature that would need to be investigated once the tag has been decided is via colour as the name is already a feature that can be implemented from the above investigation, although I&rsquo;m personally unsure of the best way to capture this I know there are many applications out there that can detect colour if there was a way to enable a check when an app is being downloaded or installed it could tag it with a colour. Alternatively, the most popular apps could easily be manually tagged with a colour category by myself or a member of the team and an app feature could also be implemented to manually tag colours so a list can be fully generated and maintained to make sure these are being tagged correctly. One of the main drawbacks of this is many people may see colours differently such as a blue may be tagged as a light blue is could be seen as a darker blue by others, this could be resolved by lumping all the blue together and not letting it get more complicated than that.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:106%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>The next feature that could be looked at is the app usage feature, as Google Play already contains a feature where you can view the last time an app was opened it may be possible to scrape this data every month to view unused apps. The less desirable option would be to have the app monitor which apps have been used in the previous 30 days, this could be a privacy concern for many users as the app would technically be monitoring the different things they are using. Many phones these days do contain a digital wellbeing section which already captures this kind of data, so it may be possible to view the apps that have already been captured by this and discount them from the installed apps to find the ones that haven&rsquo;t been used. Another problem with this is that the digital wellbeing apps normally go by weekly not monthly unless it captured the data each week and held onto that until the 30 days was up this may not work.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:106%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>After these have been scoped and planned on how they will be implemented the user interface will need to be looked at, the first iteration will just need a simple organise my button with the three different organisation settings. Once this has been created the app features can start being developed until a basic working version of the app has been created. During the development feature issues may reach roadblocks where the app cannot be developed any further as the requested feature may not be able to be implemented correctly, if this occurs it will have to go back to the drawing board to look at other ways the feature/s can be implemented and if they can&rsquo;t be made the app may change shape into something completely different. Without the technical know-how it&rsquo;s hard to say what is and isn&rsquo;t possible but as we work through the journey, all we can do it work through each problem as it arises.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:106%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>If the app reaches the stage where the desired core features have been successfully created and it is serving the purpose it was created for it will then move to the user interface design stage, to create an interface that is easy for the user to navigate and clear with what each section will do.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:106%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>If that is all created and tested successfully a beta of the app could be released to close friends and family to provide feedback on what their experience with it has been like and if they have any features suggestions.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:106%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong><span style="font-size:15px;line-height:106%;">Roles</span></strong></p>

The way we would want to manage the project it is collaborating week to week on what needs to be achieved in the next week and either take the required role/s or work together on a project.</span></p>
  <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:normal;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;'>By not assigning a role it means we will be able to easily adapt to the requirements of the project. In the same token, this could be seen as a risk as someone who only does a certain role would be much more knowledgeable in the role they perform, this is a risk but due to the limited amount of members, there isn&rsquo;t any alternative unless new members joined the project with different specialties.</span></p>

With the right skills, the whole UI can be designed and back end completed in this single free application. The deciding factor is of course being able to learn to properly use and code within this app.</span></p>

During the initial development, Android Studio can easily be used to test many different types of Android phones, once a testing routine has been established it will be easy to go through and complete the routine within this development application to see if we encounter any bugs or issues. As the app matures through its development stages, we will look to get close family and friends to test and provide feedback before allowing an open beta on the play store.</span></p>

We may not be able to use the Play Store tags for the apps to organise them and may not be able to identify colours in apps to use these for organisational purposes.</span></p>

Although this is a very common thing in the tech industry, we would essentially need to go back to the drawing board and start again.</span></p>

Discord would be the main source of communication due to how easy it is to have the app installed over different OS and phones and create different channels for different purposes. Meetings would be at least twice a week with text chat in-between meetups in the discord channels. One of the meetings in the week may be a video call through discord. It would be expected if a meeting cannot be made the other would inform the channel and provide a different time it would be able to take place while still maintaining the two meetings a week schedule.</span></p>
