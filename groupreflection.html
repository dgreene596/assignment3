I am proud of the work we have done together. Our Discord chat we had definitely helped for keeping track of this assignment, as did our Google Document we had made for all the parts. From last assignment to this one, I learned that smaller groups can be a lot more manageable when you do not have to rely upon others. Although in the workplace, this isn&rsquo;t always the case, but this is my findings from these assignments. I do believe we could have done a bit better with a third active member for our group, although we decided it was not worth the risk of having the same thing happen as our last assignment.</span></p>

We have coordinated in discord constantly either via text chat or using the voice channel and have also managed to share and keep all the required content in one area. If I had to do another group assignment Zaidyn would be one of my first picks to do that with. I&rsquo;m very happy with the work we have managed to complete given team circumstances.</span></p>
